![](./misc/tp_logo.jpg) TP: An idris package for typed, unix-style, path manipulation. 
----

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/superfunc/tp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/superfunc/tp)

#### Usage:

`TBD`

#### Dependencies:

This package provides an idris package, `System.Posix.Paths` for typed
path manipulation. I'd like to add some neat usage of dependent types to
this library, but the initial library just has Haskell-style,
strongly-typed, paths. 

#### Disclaimers:

> 1) This is work in progress, I'll update this comment when I think things are usable/exist.

> 2) This work is my sole effort and is in no way associated with or sponsored by
my current, past, or future employer(s).
