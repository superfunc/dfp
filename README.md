 ✌️ An idris package for dependently typed, unix-style, path manipulation.✌️ 

#### Usage:

`TBD`

#### Dependencies:

This package provides two high level pieces, `System.Posix.Paths` for 
pure functions regarding path manipulation, and `System.Posix.PathsIO` for 
usage of those paths with runtime file system operations. The latter portion
has a dependency on [idris-posix](https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-posix),
which you will need to provide when building this package.

#### Disclaimers:

> 1) This is work in progress, I'll update this comment when I think things are usable/exist.

> 2) This work is my sole effort and is in no way associated with or sponsored by
