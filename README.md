![](./misc/tp_logo.jpg) *An idris package for typed, unix-style, path manipulation.* 

#### Usage:

`TBD`

#### Dependencies:

This package provides an idris package, `System.Posix.Paths` for typed
path manipulation. I want to work on adding depdendently typed variants
to the available types, but the initial library just has haskell-style,
strongly typed paths.

> 1) This is work in progress, I'll update this comment when I think things are usable/exist.
