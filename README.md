![](./misc/tp_logo.jpg) TP: An idris package for typed, unix-style, path manipulation. 
----

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/superfunc/tp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/superfunc/tp)

#### Usage:

The [tests](src/Test/System/Posix/Paths.idr) provide decent examples for the time being.
Once things have been cleaned up, I'll try to provide more thorough examples here.

#### Dependencies:

This package provides an idris package, `System.Posix.Paths` for typed
path manipulation. I'd like to add some neat usage of dependent types to
this library, but the initial library just has Haskell-style,
strongly-typed, paths. 

Contributions are very welcome.
